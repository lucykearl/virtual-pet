# Exercise: Virtual Pet

In this exercise I will be creating my own vitural pet using JavaScript!

I will be able to do the followuing:

- Give them a name
- Have the ability to get older
- Take them on a walk for fitness
- Feed them
- Talk to them

I will try to include more abilities as I pass through the exercise.
